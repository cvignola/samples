# Legacy Component Sample

Applications can include legacy components as well as new, cloud native components.  This is common during application modernization scenarios, where parts of a monolith are transformed to, or replaced by, cloud native components. This [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Air32LCcj0c&feature=youtu.be) demonstrates an actual example, based on the stocktrader application. 

The sample in this repository demonstrates how you can represent and include legacy components as part of your application, as displayed by Kubernetes Application Navigator.
